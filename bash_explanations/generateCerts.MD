The function `generateCerts()` first checks if the `cryptogen` tool is installed. If it is not, the function exits with an error message.

Next, the function checks if the `crypto-config` directory already exists. If it does, the function prints a message and returns. This is because the `cryptogen` tool will overwrite any existing files in the `crypto-config` directory.

If the `crypto-config` directory does not exist, the function sets the `set -x` flag, which causes all commands to be printed to the console. This is helpful for debugging purposes.

The function then runs the `cryptogen generate` command, which generates the certificates. The `-config` flag specifies the path to the `crypto-config.yaml` file, which contains the configuration for the certificates.

The function then sets the `set +x` flag, which stops printing commands to the console.

Finally, the function checks the return code of the `cryptogen generate` command. If the return code is not 0, the function exits with an error message.

The `generateCerts()` function is a useful way to generate certificates for a Hyperledger Fabric network. It is important to note that the `cryptogen` tool is only used for testing purposes. In a production environment, you should use a different tool to generate certificates.
