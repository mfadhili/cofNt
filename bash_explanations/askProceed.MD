The code you provided defines a shell function called `askProceed`. The function prompts the user to answer "Continue?" and accepts only "Y", "y", or an empty line as an affirmative response. Any other response is considered invalid and the function will prompt the user again.

If the user enters an affirmative response, the function will print the message "proceeding ...". Otherwise, the function will print the message "exiting..." and exit with a status of 1.

The following is an explanation of the code:

```shell
function askProceed () {
  read -p "Continue? [Y/n] " ans
  case "$ans" in
    y|Y|"" )
      echo "proceeding ..."
    ;;
    n|N )
      echo "exiting..."
      exit 1
    ;;
    * )
      echo "invalid response"
      askProceed
    ;;
  esac
}
```

* The `function` keyword defines the start of the function.
* The parentheses are used to group the function arguments.
* The `read` command prompts the user for input and assigns the response to the variable `ans`.
* The `case` statement checks the value of `ans` and executes the corresponding code.
* The `echo` command prints a message to the console.
* The `exit` command terminates the function and exits the shell with the specified status.

I hope this explanation is helpful. Let me know if you have any other questions.

Here is the output of the code:

```shell
Continue? [Y/n] y
proceeding ...
```

The user enters "y" as an affirmative response, so the function prints the message "proceeding ...".

If the user enters "n" as a negative response, the function will print the message "exiting..." and exit with a status of 1.

If the user enters any other response, the function will print the message "invalid response" and prompt the user again.
