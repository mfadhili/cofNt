## Pushd
The code you provided is a shell function that defines the `pushd` command. The `pushd` command is used to save the current directory into a stack and move to a new directory. The function takes one argument, which is the directory to push onto the stack. The function then calls the built-in `pushd` command, redirecting the output to `/dev/null`. This prevents the `pushd` command from printing the stack to the console.

The following is an explanation of the code:

```shell
pushd () {
    command pushd "$@" > /dev/null
}
```

* The `pushd` keyword defines the start of the function.
* The parentheses are used to group the function arguments.
* The `command` keyword is used to execute the built-in `pushd` command.
* The `$@` variable is used to pass the function arguments to the `pushd` command.
* The `> /dev/null` redirect redirects the output of the `pushd` command to the file `/dev/null`.

I hope this explanation is helpful. Let me know if you have any other questions.


## Popd
The code you provided is a shell function that defines the `popd` command. The `popd` command is used to remove the top directory from the stack and change to that directory. The function takes no arguments, but it can take an optional argument to specify the number of directories to pop from the stack. The function then calls the built-in `popd` command, redirecting the output to `/dev/null`. This prevents the `popd` command from printing the stack to the console.

The following is an explanation of the code:

```shell
popd () {
    command popd "$@" > /dev/null
}
```

* The `popd` keyword defines the start of the function.
* The parentheses are used to group the function arguments.
* The `command` keyword is used to execute the built-in `popd` command.
* The `$@` variable is used to pass the function arguments to the `popd` command.
* The `> /dev/null` redirect redirects the output of the `popd` command to the file `/dev/null`.

To use the `popd` function, you would first need to source it into your shell. You can do this by typing the following command:

```shell
source myfunctions.sh
```

Once the function is sourced, you can use it by typing the following command:

```shell
popd
```

This will remove the top directory from the stack and change to that directory.

If you want to pop a specific number of directories from the stack, you can use the following syntax:

```shell
popd number_of_directories
```

For example, the following command would pop two directories from the stack:

```shell
popd 2
```

I hope this explanation is helpful. Let me know if you have any other questions.
